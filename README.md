#XMAS-Battle
A small server that runs a tug-of-war style game with node and socket.io. I built it basically to teach myself a bit more about sockets, so it will update a lot (hopefully.)

You can demo it [here](http://xmas-batter.jit.su).

###Installing

```
$ git clone git://github.com/individual11/xmas-battle.git
$ cd xmas-battle
$ npm install
```

You will want to change some stuff in the server.js, (which I will move to a config one of these days.)
